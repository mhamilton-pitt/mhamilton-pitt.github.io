Hi! I'm Mike, I'm an Assistant Professor of Business Analytics and Operations at the [University of Pittsburgh Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business](https://www.katz.business.pitt.edu/), and an affiliated member of the Center for Analytical Approaches to Social Innovation [(CAASI)](https://www.caasi.pitt.edu/). I received my Ph.D. from Columbia University in [Operations Research](https://ieor.columbia.edu/) where I was advised by [Adam N. Elmachtoub](http://www.columbia.edu/~ae2516/). Before that, I earned a B.Sc. from Rutgers University in [Mathematics](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/). 

My research centers around pricing and market design. I examine how changes in the structure and mechanics of price offerings affect market outcomes, with diverse applications in e-commerce and market design for social good. For more details about my work, please see my [CV](https://mhamilton-pitt.github.io/files/CV.pdf), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kJjuGMgAAAAJ&hl=en), and/or my [Papers](https://mhamilton-pitt.github.io/publications/).

If this sort of work sounds interesting to you, I am always on the lookout for timely problems, strong students, and new collaborators. [Are you interested in working with me?
